# Robotic Chess Arm with Computer Vision

## Overview
This project implements a robotic arm capable of playing chess autonomously.  
The system uses computer vision to recognize the chessboard and piece positions, and controls a robotic manipulator to execute chess moves.  

## Features
- üé• **Computer Vision**: Detects chessboard and tracks piece positions using OpenCV.  
- ü§ñ **Robotic Arm Control**: Executes moves through inverse kinematics and motion planning.  
- ‚ôüÔ∏è **Chess Logic**: Interfaces with a chess engine to decide moves or accept human input.  
- üîÑ **Integration**: Combines vision, logic, and actuation into a complete system.  

## Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python / C++ (for control modules)  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, [chess engine library e.g. python-chess]  
- **Hardware**: Robotic arm (servo/stepper based), camera (webcam/USB), microcontroller (Arduino/ROS compatible)  

## System Architecture
1. **Image Processing** ‚Üí Capture and preprocess board image.  
2. **Chessboard Recognition** ‚Üí Detect board grid and pieces.  
3. **Move Detection** ‚Üí Identify changes and compute valid moves.  
4. **Robotic Arm Control** ‚Üí Translate moves into robotic commands.  
5. **Execution** ‚Üí Robotic arm picks and places chess pieces.
